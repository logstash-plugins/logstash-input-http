## 3.0.2
  - Use a new class as redefined Puma::Server class as we need to mock one method and only need it for this plugin, but not for all parts using puma in logstash.Fixes https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/issues/51.
## 3.0.1
  - Republish all the gems under jruby.
## 3.0.0

# 2.2.2
  - Depend on logstash-core-plugin-api instead of logstash-core, removing the need to mass update plugins on major releases of logstash

  - New dependency requirements for logstash-core for the 5.0 release
## 2.2.0
 - Bump puma dependency to 2.16.0

## 2.1.1

## 2.1.0

## 2.0.0
